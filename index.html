            <li>Up at 5am. Almost slept in, but decided to be consistent, even on weekends.</li>
            <li>Revisited <code>.forEach</code> method. Lesson 165. I will come back to it. I feel like it has traces of list comprehensions.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to reading Eloquent Javascript, one of the books in my javascript playlist at Safari books online.</li>
            <li>Started learning about Javascript Objects; this is similar to a Dictionary in Python.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>I have been doing the Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB) on Udemy. Now on lesson 157 of 400. Javascript arrays.
                 It's pretty similar to Python with a few minor differences so far. indexOf vs. index, " , " vs. " : ", and function vs. def - among other things..</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was listening to "Javascript for Wordpress" podcast, and the guest compared learning a programming language to a human language... That you need to learn the fundamentals (important phrases) and keep building until you can write parapgraphs, carry a conversation, write a novel, analyze the ideas, etc. That resonated with me! It also made me not judge javascript by python standards, as I cannot judge one human language against the other. Learn it or ignore it!</li>
            <li>I have been working out in the morning and in the evening. May be workout is a stretch. But I stretch and do few reps of super light dumbbells in the morning, and then walk 1 mile on the treadmill. I like it. Trying to eat healthier at the same time.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the freecodecamp podcast where Quincy interviewed ... the Software Engineering Daily host! It was 2 hours long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was inspiring on so many levels, to me.</li>
            <li>Time to start getting ready for work. It's 7:46am. Should be out by 8:15am, latest! TGIF!</li>
            <li>Going through Javascript lessons before I sleep. I initially planned to just watch and then "later" do the coding at SoloLearn (the coding App), or when I go to freeCodeCamp later in the year. My reason was that I am just trying to get familiar with Javascript and get a flavor of it - whatever that means. Anyway, I am doing the coding exercises now, like I did for most of HTML and CSS. Here is some basic code.</li>
            <li><p><code><pre>
//Function to find maximum number in an array of numbers
<!--

function printMax(myArray){
    var max = myArray[0];
    for(i=0; i<myArray.length; i++){
        if(myArray[i] > max){
            max = myArray[i];
        }
          }
return max
}


dux = [3, 1, 8, 6, 10, -100, 99, 12, 1]

printMax(dux) -->

            </pre>
            </code></p></li>
            
            
            <li><p><code><pre>
            
//Function to print an array of numbers in reverse
<!--
            
            var max = 0
function printMax(myArray){
    var max = myArray[0];
    for(i=1; i<=myArray.length; i++){
        if(myArray[i] > max){
            max = myArray[i];
        }
          }
return max
}


tux = [3, 1, 8, 6, 10, 100, 99, 12, 1]

printMax(tux)
-->
                </pre>
                </code></p></li>

                <li><p><code><pre>
            
//Function to check if all elements of an array are identical
<!-- 
function isUniform(myArray){
 var count = 1;
 var first = myArray[0];
 
 for(i=1; i<myArray.length; i++){
     if(first === myArray[i]){
         count += 1;
     }
 if(count === myArray.length){
     console.log("TRUE"); 
     if else{
        console.log("FALSE")
        }
          }
 isUniform([2,2,2,2,2])
-->

                </pre>

            <li>freecodecamp podcast. Deep work, focus, code every day. African / Nigerian dude in Berlin.</li>
            <li>The Web Dev Bootcamp in Udemy. Age in days calculator. Simple, I didn't even try it. :-)</li>
            <li>Thinking I should sleep early and wake up early. I woke up at 4:30am today. One of the most productivedays I have hard.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>For the past couple of weeks/months I have been binge listening to podcasts on particular individuals: Nathan Barry of Convertkit,
              Chris Sacca of Lowercase capital, Josh Pigford of Baremetrics, Quincy Larson of freeCodeCamp, Wes Bos of Javascript30, Evan You of Vue.js, 
              Patrick Collison of Stripe, Shivani Siroya of InVenture, and many others. I realized that listening to several podcasts on the same person 
              provided more depth. Not different from when I was doing research for the "MOnetize Like The Best" blog.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks ago, I read "Not Fade Away". It made me rethink how I look at life. Life is short. Treasure each moment.</li>
            <li>The Web Developer Bootcamp continues. Bootstrap 3 completed. I didn't do any exercises. I started Bootstrap 4, but stopped and moved
              forward to Javascript. I have been looking forward to starting Javascript for a while. The first few lessons are a breeze due to my experience with Python.
            I will revist bootstrap via freeCodeCamp. </li>
            <li>Thinking about how I will use this programming knowledge I am "accumulating". Trading algorithms, work dashboards, quiz forums, personal apps, side gigs, ... ... ???</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>I have been watching for the past week or so. Now on lesson 71. Hundreds to go. Life long journey.

          and how to design the sites.</li>
        <li>It's true that when you look at the web, you would think that all there is to create has already been created. No room for you! Not so!</li>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+table" target="_blank">tables</a>. Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis/playlists" target="_blank">MMTUTS</a>
             while looking for that. Not switching yet. Focus. Finish what you start.</li>
          <li>Going on a small vacation. Wednesday - Sunday. May not code. Focus on vacation. ;-)</li>
          <li>Listened to The Side Hustle Show last night.
            <a href="https://www.sidehustlenation.com/pinterest-traffic/" target="_blank">ep. 142</a>,
            <a href="https://www.sidehustlenation.com/building-a-20k-month-blog/" target="_blank">ep. 199</a>.
            Learnt about Pinterest & web traffic & marketing. Keep learning.</li>
          <li>Thinking about what direction to take my online presence. So many ideas.</li>
          <li>I am passionate about trading.
            I think I will use my programming skills to create freemium apps for traders. Some day.</li>
          <li>Bought two domain names related to trading.</li>
          <li>Researching blog ideas, esp. design and services.</li>
          <li>Reviewing my portfolio of domains to see what I should focus on, what to (not) keep,
            and how to design the sites.</li>
          <li>It's true that when you look at the web, you would think that all there is to create has already been created. No room for you! Not so!</li>

            <li>Busy with work. Month close. Travel. Life. etc.
              Still thinking about coding - and listening to podcasts.</li>
            <li>Blogged a bit about
              <a href="https://trading2fi.com/trading-to-fi-critical-success-factors-4-of-x-pursuing-financial-independence/" target="_blank">trading</a>.
              Mostly last week.</li>
            <li>Thinking about ways to focus / speed up this programming journey, with regard to trading / market analysis.</li>
            <li>Thinking about what language to focus on. Go back to Python? Continue R? Continue HTML / CSS/ JS?</li>
            <li>I have decided to continue with the web dev journey even though I am not planning to be a web developer.</li>
            <li>Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg/playlists" target="_blank">

            <li>A couple of things I am looking forward to: sectioning, internal linking, navigation, styling,

              to offset work busyness.</li>
            <li>Surprised by FCC's usage of <code>id</code> instead of <code>name</code>.</li>
            <li>Back to work... Let's sync w/ GH.</li>
            <li>Flew through FCC's basic HTML lessons as I was familiar with most of the content.
            </br>**Learned some new stuff:</li>

                <li>forms,</li>
                <li>submit button,</li>
                <li>text input,</li>
                <li>required field,</li>
                <li>radio buttons, [This was challenging. Got it, but I will need to revisit.]</li>
                <li>checkboxes, [incl checked by default]</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
