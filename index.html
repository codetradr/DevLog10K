          <ul>
            <li>Back in Edmonton; I have been here the past 6 months. Covid-19 restrictions and work from home.</li>
            <li>On and off programming and trading. Blown up my trading account(s) a few times this year. Now taking a break from trading. I need to test my strategies, manage risk, and control my emotions.</li>
            <li>Started going through QuantConnect tutorials about a week ago. (Before that I had looked into Backtrader (a python backtesting library), and a bunch of youtube tutorials on various things. I had gone through Serenium lessons to automate some data downloads (before I cancelled my barchart subscription).</li>
            <li>Bought "Python Crash Course" for the second time. I left my old copy in LA and I think it is too old. Eric H. Matthes, the author, recommended that I buy the latest edition. (I had emailed him. It was nice to get a quick response from him!) So I did. There are free copies online, but that didn't sit well with me. I decided to start from the basics all over again, before I continue with QuantConnect. I have been avoiding "classes" in the past couple of years, but at QuantConnect, I was forced to use them. I sort of understood what was going on, but not as well as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am going through the exercises. I could do most of them in my heard as I know python basics pretty good - and I have written a few scripts over the past 6 years or so. Partly is to practice coding regularly. Partly is to see if what I am thinking actually works. Also, there is something to seeing the output vs. just imagining it. </li>
            <li>I have been writing down all sorts of trading (options) ideas to test on QuantConnect. There is a possibility that I will just write about my tests, but keep my trading simple. Just trade a la "thetagang".</li>
            <li>I would like to write an app that teaches accounting basics. A colleague at work asked me if I could help "them" with accounting. I agreed to help, and now I am thinking I could come up with something since I am interested in programming, blogging, and I have some expertise in Accounting. This is better than the CPA exam tips or other blog ideas I ventured into. If this works, I may have a YouTube channel as well down the line.</li> 
            <li>I learned Power Query about a month or so ago. There was a project I had to do at work and there were millions of lines/rows in the file I was working with. I used SQLite and python, but somehow googled Excel millions of rows ... and I found a blog post that talked about loading / working with 15 million(?) rows of data in Excel. I was hooked. I have since done a few things using Power Query, including automating some data munging. I got a few books that I would like to plough through down the line.</li>
            <li>Went through a lesson or two of Django, but I didn't have good use of it. Now I have a clear vision of what I will use it for.</li>
            <li>I struggled with tracking my option positions in TWS and exporting to Excel to see what was hedging what was just a pain. I hope to find or write an up that works out option positions for box trades or butterflies or other complex positions. That might be a lifetime project!</li> 
            <li>I had subscribed to ivolatility about 2 weeks ago, but I cancelled it after a week or so. Also cancelled BarChart subcription. I need(ed) a break from trading.</li>
            <li>Month end close next week. I hope to still program for an hour or so every day.</li>
            <li>I am on page 91. beginning of chapter 6: Dictionaries, in Python Crash Course. It's been a quick read so far. I have learnt quite a bit. Things that I didn't remember reading before, or they didn't make sense. I have noticed that I cannot stand repeating code, so I have been writing functions for most of the exercises even though the topic has not been introduced. Here is an example:
              
            <code>
            <pre>
            
            # check if username chosen by new user is available (or already taken). Case insensitive. Print appropriate message ... 
            
            users = ['George', 'Dallas', 'mike', 'admin', 'Andy']
            new_users = ['Mike', 'Charles', 'Tonnie', 'dallas']

            def user_sign_up():
                for name in new_users:
                            if name.lower() in [user.lower() for user in users]:
                                print(f"Sorry, the username, {name}, is already taken. Please try a different username.")
                            else:
                                print(f"The username, {name}, is available!")
                # don't remember if i need to return(name) here ...

            user_sign_up()
          
            </pre>
            </code>
            </li>
            <li>I can't wait to go through the projects in the book. I have given myself til the end of the year to finish the book.</li>
            <li>I really liked the reddit AMA that ehmatthes did. It was what led me back to reading PCC. How thoughtful he is! I listed to an episode of Django Chat - Python Crash Course - Eric Matthes 2 days ago ... and I think I have listened to it before. But it was very good as well. It doesn't appear that he has done many interviews ... or I couldn't find them on Spotify. May be I should look up his PyCon(?) talks.</li>
            <li>In the AMA, ehmatthes mentioned WSVincent as author of very good Django books ... so I am looking forward to reading those next year.</li>
            <li>I have forgotten almost all the HTML and CSS that I learned a while ago! I don't recall what I did to come up with the posts here. Luckily, one of the projects in PCC is to build a blog, so I will probably get back some of the knowledge.</li>
            <li>It's good to see my VS Code ipython notebook get to cell 243! I hadn't paid attention to this until a while ago when I was scrolling up to look up something. Keep learning. Keep coding. Keep practicing/practising!.</li>
            <li>Let's build skills, capital, and attain FI!</li>
            <li>Took a break. Went to the river valley for a nice walk with wifey. Then grocery shopping, followed by dinner, doing dishes... and back to programming.</li>
            <li>Something I forgot to say about the advantages of actually typing out the code, (even though the concepts make sense in the head,) is that the typing makes it easier to "accept"/"adopt" certain concepts. For example, I was "resistant" to <code>.format</code> and <code> f strings</code>. But now that I have been going through the exercises and typing out the print statements with f strings, it is now much easier. Actually, I think the concepts are better understood. I have made mistakes like forgetting the closing quotes, etc. </li>
            <li>Almost done with Ch. 6 of PCC, Dictionaries. Learnt a lot. Reminds me of Programming for Everybody offered by University of Michigan on Coursera. I wish I had finished that course. I will probably do it again. I like Dr. Chuck (Severance). Tomorrow, I will go through "Try It Yourself: 6-7 through 6-12." Then onto Ch. 7 User Input and While Loops!</li>
            <li>I really like the explanation on Dictionaries in a List ... by creating a ton of objects each with properties (key, value) in a dictionary, ... and then modifying slices of the list with conditions and all! That broadened my thinking on games. I am realizing that one of my "resistances" was in coding games, because I am not and I was never a gamer. However, understanding the programming of a game, (the little I have been exposed to thus far), has changed my mental posture.</li>
            <li>Good night! It's only 9:48pm</li>

          <ul>
            <li>It's been a while since I last programmed and since I logged my programming efforts.</li>
            <li>I have been thinking about what I plan to do that will make me "happy" - programming-wise. It is trading.</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to Python and get to a point where I can use it to analyze trading data and trading ideas.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago I watched FreeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw" target="_blank">Python tutorial</a> on youtube. It was a very good review. Thank you Mike Dane! Thank you FreeCodeCamp! Thank you YouTube!</li>
            <li>This weekend, I spent a bit of time looking into more Python resources and earnestly started reviewing and learning Python. I have done the following.
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lessons 1 - 5 of <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/python-fundamentals/9780135917411" target="_blank">Python Fundamentals</a> by Paul J. Deitel</li>
                    <li>Week 1 of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data" target="_blank">Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python</a> - offered by University of Michigan on Coursera</li>
                    <li>Lesson 1 of <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-science-fundamentals/9780134660141" target="_blank">Data Science Fundamentals</a> by Jonathan Dinu.</li>
                  </ul>
              
            </li>
            <li>My plan is to focus on the Python Fundamentals tutorials for the next few weeks / months.</li>
            <li>I need to learn Statistics. So, the Coursera course is part of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python" target="_blank">Statistics with Python Specialization</a>. </li>
            <li>Listening to the usual podcasts: trading, productivity, and programming.</li>
            <li>The other day I realized that I was in a trade which I had initiated without testing and I was holding on as the trade lost about 25% or 30%. I decided to close it even though I felt it would be profitable. It actually would have been very profitable (according to what the market did after I got out.) I, however, told myself that I needed to have a base for trading - and I didn't deserve to make money if I didn't know what I was doing. In addition, I wanted something researched, repeatable, with rules, etc. It is the best trade I have made to date!</a>
            <li>I did a lot of thinking. :-) 
                 <ul>
                   <li>I thought about how to turn go about removing the automatic renewal on my several hundred domains. I had been putting it off for a while because I thought that manually doing it - one by one - at 10 a day would take me over 40 days. Then it occurred to me that I could ask Google to do it for me. I was really happy with the "insight". One day I started a chat with Google and they told me they couldn't do it. I expressed my disappointment - and I persisted in asking why it couldn't be done. I don't know if I asked for a manager or not, but I was told the issue would be escalated to senior support or whatever, and then a day or two later, I heard back from them ... and the rest is history! So, I have to consciously decide to keep certain of my domains. I plan to keep 10 or so."</li>
                   <li>I already mentioned the trade I had to close.</li>
                   <li>How to get option data to trade with or to analyze. I think that when I am ready, the data will come/will show up, or I will look into it.</li>
                   <li>My trading blog. Whether to start writing now or wait until I start analyzing data. I have been making notes of my ideas / blog post ideas. Psychology things. Books I want to read and write about. Whether to shut down my current trading blog or not. etc.</li>
              </li>
                   </ul>
              </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Sometimes things don't go as planned... Super sick all day. Kind of random. Feeling better now.</li>
            <li>Listened to a few interesting programming podcasts: Javascript Air ep. 2 - <a href="https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2015-12-16/" target="_blank">Learning and Developing Javascript</a>, ep. 1 with Brendan Eich - <a href="https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2015-12-09/" target="_blank">The Past, Present, and Future of Javascript</a>, Code Newbie with Vanessa Hurst - <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/autotune-inclusivity-and-getting-a-job" target="_blank">Autotune, Inclusivity, and Getting A Job</a>, etc.</li>
            <li>Watched a <a href="http://2015.jsconf.us/" target="_blank">2015 JSconf</a> video in which Ashley G. Williams gave a presentation. It was interesting and thought-provoking.</li>
            <li>Lesson of the day. For loop has 3 things: <em>State</em>, <em>Condition</em>, and <em>Increment (Decrement)</em>. I have written many for loops, but for some reason, I didn't have the names or labels of what I was doing at each stage.</li>
            <li>Going to walk at a park. I will do some programming afterwards.5PM-ish.</li>
            <li>Listened to some podcast featuring Andy Didorosi, Basecamp's Head of Marketing. I think he was still running his bus company when he was interviewed. He has an inspiring story on how he started the Detroit Bus Company. I liked the naration on ReWork podcast better. "<a href="https://rework.fm/meet-andy/" target="_blank">Meet Andy"</a>.</li>
            <li>Listened to InfoQ podcast: Martin Hadley on R and the modern R ecosystem. I am not sure if I will go back to R. Granted I didn't get much into it. But I owe it to R's Shiny package for giving me the motivation to start on the Javascript and/or Web Dev path. I just didn't want to use Shiny without understanding how/why it was working. I remember watvhing a couple of videos where the creator of Shiny said he had picked up all sorts of experiences in his Web Dev past. etc.</li>
            <li>I just completed the "faker" exercise in the Web Dev Bootcamp. This was fun. Using Node to install faker, and then reading the docs to see how to generate fake products and fake prices. <a href="https://marak.github.io/faker.js/" target="_blank">Github.com</a> & <a href="https://www.javascripting.com/view/faker-js" target="_blank">Javascripting.com</a>. Then wrote a function to print the generated data. Simple but fun to do.</li>
            <li>Express.js is next!</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Took it a bit easy yesterday. Listening to podcasts re: procrastination. iproctastinate podcast, Tim Urban on the Tim Ferriss show (ep. 283), the Art of Manliness (ep. 356), David Allen on Decoding Superhuman podcast, etc. 11/1/2019.</li>
            <li>Busy at work. Management responses to Internal Audit findings. 11/1/2019.</li>
            <li>LA vs. Edmonton. Resetting life using minimalism. 11/1/2019.</li>
            <li>At the library. The Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB) - the command line, etc. I will be here for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Synced this PC to github. I haven't used this laptop in a while. I just scrolled through the old commands to find the one to pull the respository. The WDB has lessons on Git, so I will review it when the time comes.</li>
            <li>One of the most productive days I have had. Not programming wise. Pretty happy!</li>
            <li>I bought a greeting card for myself @ Trader Joe's. "The Day you decide to do it, will be your lucky day!" - Japanese proverb. It spoke to me.</li>
            <li>It was interesting to hear rambunctious kids playing in the kids section of the library! I managed to do some studying. 2 1/2 hours or so.</li>
            <li>The WDB. Completed the command line lessons and exercises. Started NodeJS.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to reading <a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/" target="_blank">"Getting To Know The Command Line"</a> - online book by David Baumgold.</li>.
            <li>Almost done with NodeJS lessons. Not sure if I will do the NPM faker exercise tonight or tomorrow. I have done quite a bit of things today.</li>
            <li>It was nice to listen to the <a href="https://revisionpath.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">Revision Path</a> podcast after a long time. I was looking for something and saw Iheanyi Ekechukwu. He had an interesting Bio, so I listened to two podcasts in which he was a guest. One of them was Revision Path (ep. 102). Inspiring.</li>
            <li>Placed a hold on some Javascript books at the library. Not sure if that was a good idea. I think I have enough resources.</li>
            <li>Past new bed time (10pm). Good night!</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Woke up around 2:30am. Decided to read a book. Cracked open a book set I got a few months ago: Cal Newport's "So good they can't ignore you" and "Deep Work." A while back, I listened to a few podcasts where Cal was interviewed... and I enjoyed them a lot.</li>
            <li>"So good they can't ignore you" - Rule #1: "Don't Follow Your Passion." I will be reading one chapter or rule a day.</li>
            <li>5am. Going back to bed. No programming, unless I can't sleep.</li>
            <li>Up again around 6pm. Watched a bit of intro to back end, part I. Workout. Bfast. Ready for work.</li>
            <li>7:45pm-ish continued with WDB, intro to back end part I. Then part II. I really enjoyed these two videos. Colt is a really good teacher! I have tried to get my head around certain verbage in (the code of) an app before, and it didn't make sense to me. Looking back, I think it is because the intros were not done well and I was probably not ready. This time around, I am cool with just getting the concepts and trusting that I will have plentry of coding practice in the next few decades.</li>
            <li>Setting up coding environment ... in the cloud. ide.GoormIDE.io, c9.io, ... I think that Microsoft's Azure would have a javascript and Nodejs developer environment. Yup!  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/javascript/" target="_blank">Azure for JavaScript & Node.js developers</a>.</li>
            <li>The cloud developer envs reminded me of "Repl.it" founder Amjad Masad, featured on Software Engineering Daily podcast. Listened to it a couple of weeks ago... I really liked the guy, his thinking, long term view, and humility.</li>
            <li>May be I should take a look at Repl.it ... at some point.</li>
            <li>10:19pm... time to sleep. 19 minutes late!</li>

            <li>Woke up super early today. I really wanted to sleep some more. Then 5am alarm came and I willed myself to do my 5am work. The WDB.</li>
            <li>Patatap clone project. Just watched. Key take aways: read the docs, follow examples in the docs, and just do it! I guess I can read the docs for Pivot.js</li>
            <li>After listening to quite a few podcasts (on UltraLearning) between last week and this week, I am thinking about how I can implement that in my own life.</li>
            <li>James Altucher, the Mad Fientist, Bookworm, etc. a few podcasts on which I listened to / about UltraLearning.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow, I start Backend basics. The Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB).</li>
            <li>I have had a browser tab open on <a href="https://docs.sheetjs.com/#sheetjs-js-xlsx" target="_blank">sheetjs</a> ... not sure what I was looking into.</li>
            <li>Need to apply some of the knowledge I have got to this website. Drop down for dates. Alternating background colors for lists or posts.</li>

            <li>UIgradient.com, FortAwesome.com (FontAwesome), alternating list colors with child(2n), other creative tricks...</li>
            <li>More libraries. PaperJS, HowlerJS</li>
            <li>Almost 6am. Need to nap.</li>

            <li>The WDB up to lesson 224.</li>
            <li>Perused Duckett's Javascript/JQuery book. Happy to see "filtering", "sorting", "searching" at the end of the book.</li>
            <li>If all goes well, I will complete the WDB by end of Nov. Just want to be exposed to what's possible. I will revisit the course later.</li>
            <li>Bought a domain for my friend, François. Thinking about buying some CPE related domains. Also, reactivating/launching wizoftheday. <-- Brief intros.</li>
            <li>One hour per week = 52 hours of whatever. CPE, blog posts, reading a book, biking, etc.</li>

            <li>CPE. 5 hours. Read a bit of "Beginning Javascript - 5th Ed. last night.</li>
            <li>Relaxing a bit in Edmonton. Canadian Federal elections. Nothing to do with coding :-)</li>
            <li>William McDowell - "Even Now". Awesome song!.</li>
            <li>The WDB - to do list. Intro to project. Lesson 220. It was nice to see the alternating colors of the rows.  I was thinking about that for my future App. a la Pivot.js.</li>
            <li>CPE will eat into my coding time for the next 3 months or so. Need to get to 120 hours before year end. 2 hours per day can do the trick.</li>

            <li>I need to make time for CPE. 1 hour / day should be good.</li>
            <li>I listened to an interview with Amjad Masad (creator/co-founder of Repl.it) on Software Engineering daily podcast. It was humbling and inspiring. Solving problems, patience, long term view, openness, humble beginnings, etc. I want to take a look at Repl.it</li>
            <li>I remembered that I had taken a look at ThinkScript, the programming language for ThinkOrSwim, but I never got deep into it. Now with all the reading/learning I have done between Python and Javascript, I feel I could learn it pretty good. I have written some simple Python scripts before, so I have an idea of what that would entail. For now, I want to stick to my goal of finishing what I start - at least this first go around. The WDB.</li>
            <li>Finished jQuery lessons of the WDB. Now on lesson 219. The To Do List project.</li>
            <li>Last night, I started watching Tony Alicea's YouTube video: <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts" target="_blank">Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts - The First 3.5 Hours</a></em>. I don't remember what I was looking for, but noticed that it had over 2M views, so I figured it must be good. It is really good! I only watched 30 minutes of it before I slept, but already learned a ton of info. I will watch 30 minutes / day for the next week or so.</li>
            <li>Saw some nice Python & R courses on DataCamp. Last night. Read a bit about what the courses are about, but resisted the temptation to log in and take a serious look. I really like R even though I didn't go deep into it. It was my serious motivation to learn javascript because I thought JS would help with rShiny. Convoluted story.</li>
            <li>I don't know where all this will end up, but I feel like I have to continue on this programmming path. At some point, things will become clearer. I can't wait to write a trading app that has a data connection and all. Yesterday, I realized that I could do my analysis offline in a different language, and just write the results on my website. I would like to automate the research a bit. Work and wait!</li>

            <li>Watching the WDB videos. I like how jQuery shortens the code one has to write to play with the DOM(?). Reminds me of the Pandas library in Python. I am sure there are other cool Python libraries, but Pandas is the one I had used the most and really liked. I had some doubts about embracing jQuery, thinking that it was better to use vanilla JS, ... but I think I will try to learn to use both... inline with Weston Ruter's recommendation.</li>
            <li>While watching lesson 216 of the WDB, I saw that Colt went to <a href="https://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes" target="_blank">Cambia Research website</a> to look up key/code combination for jQuery Kepress event. First, I was blown away by the name of the website, then by Colt's research, then by the fact that Cambia Research appears to be a trading firm ... and I am passionate about trading! I would like to write trading algos in Javascript some day. Granted it might be easier to do in Python considering all the helpful resources out there. Quantopian, IB Python API, etc. Anyway, I started reading some things on programming at the Cambia Research website, and it was interesting. I can't wait to read more. I already like "the programmer's code" series.</li>
            <li>Well, it is 7:02am. Time to make Oatmeal - eat breakfast - shower - start off for work by 8am.</li>

            <li>Update being done on 10/15. Such (delays in updating the log) happen when I am busy with life and documentation is pushed to the back burner. I will keep trying to do it daily, or as soon as I am "done" doing something programming. It's important - and I like to see the "commit streak"!
            <li>Woke up 5am, watched a WDB lesson/video or two, made breakfast, ate, and went back to bed. I was way too sleep to face the day! I am glad I napped for another hour. It helped throughout the day.</li>
            <li>jQuery is interesting. Spent a bit of time watching videos and reading things jQuery.</li>
            <li>Watched and liked the video where the creator of Node.js (Ryan Dahl) discussed his regrets about the library. (Almost) everything was above my head, but I got the gist of it. Issues with software design and not knowing the future!</li>
            <li>On Sunday, 10/13/2019, I had listened to this interview on Javascript fo WordPress podcast. Ep.6 with Weston Ruter. It was very insightful. Learn the details to understand what's going under the hood, but also use the resources that speed up your work... We stand on the shoulders of giants and we have limited time.</li>
            <li>I should read Javascript: the good parts. Javascript - Novice to Ninja.</li>
            <li>Bought Svekis' course on Udemy: The Monster Javascript Course - 50+ projects, etc. I have seen Svekis' name a lot on Safari Books Online. Mostly videos. I saved them to my playlist. I "flipped" through the html files to see what the final builds would look like. It was really good to see. I can't wait to start building my own portfolio of things using JS.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Watched Advanced DOM Manipulation videos before going to church. (The Web Developer bootcamp.) I didn't code along. I just wanted to see how much I could follow.</li>
            <li>Watched The Color Game Project after church / lunch. I just finished. It was amazing to see the thought process and attention to detail. Lots of things were over my head, but I wasn't bothered by it. I will keep learning and practicing and I am sure I will get better over time. I really like the refactoring and design pattern parts.</li>
            <li>About to start JQuery. Section 18, Unit 205.</li>
            <li>I have always liked how my thinking to problem solving changed when I started learning Python. I am looking forward to better thinking as I become a better programmer.</li>
            <li>I was a bit down yesterday by how much I don't know, as well as the fact that it is not straightforward how I will use my programming knowledge. There are professional developers who build things that don't turn into anything. etc. I had to remind myself that I will still be an accountant, and a trader, and being a "developer" is not my primary goal. I could turn it on, if needed, as long as I keep learning and getting better at it. Just enjoy it. Learn something new every day - and compound the knowledge. I am already better at Javascript or HTML or CSS than I ever thought possible last year. I used to "dislike" the JS syntax, but now it doesn't bother me. So, lots of progress.</li>
            <li>Last night I wrote down what I want to do with respect to getting better at Javascript. I wrote down the resources I will use:
            <ul>
              <li>The Web Developer Bootcamp. Udemy. It is what I am doing now. Thanks Colt Steele!</li>
              <li>Eloquent Javascript. I started reading it yesterday and I really liked it. Decided to stop. I have to finish what I start. Finish The Web Developer Bootcamp first and then move on to other things.</li>
              <li>The FreeCodeCamp. I think I will get a ton of practice there. There are a lot of concepts that haven't sunk in from doing the WDB, so FCC will help. My reasoning is that WDB will give me a comprehensive picture of what can be done, instead of bits by bits.</li>
              <li>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). Reference.</li>
              <li>W3resource.com - to practice via the exercises / quizzes.</li>
              <li>Javascript.info - seems like a big brother to Eloquent Javascript.</li>
              <li>Coursera - University of Michigan & Johns Hopkins - both have cool web developer courses. I started both a while back, but didn't complete them. I can see myself flying through them.</li>
              <li>Safari Books Online - I have a ton of books in my playlist. On Javascript, I am looking forward to reading:
                <ul>
                  <li>Javascript: The Definitive Guide, 7th edition, by David Flanagan</li>
                  <li>Javascript and Open Data</li>
                  <li>Data Wrangling with Javascript</li>
                  <li>Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                  <li>Single Page App Development with Javascript</li>
                  <li>Javascript Functional Programming</li>
                  <li>Javascript Novice to Ninja</li>
                  <li>Many other books and videos ... </li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Complete Javascript Course - by Jonas - at Udemy. I may have bought this around the same time I bought the WDB course. I sort of started it, but didn't get into it. I looked at the list of lessons yesterday and it is somewhat similar to the WDB. I guess it has to, even though the focus is on JS. You can go deep into JS without touching the web. I look forward to spending a month or so [1 hour / day] to go through it all.</li>
                <li>I bought two books by Jon Duckett: HTML & CSS, and Javascript & JQuery. This was a few months(?) ago, when I started a coursera Web Dev course by JHU. I scanned the books real quick and they will be helpful in reviewing certain things. They are 500 pages each. :-)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Time to go to the park for a walk. 5:33pm.</li>

            <li>Up at 5am. Almost slept in, but decided to be consistent, even on weekends.</li>
            <li>Revisited <code>.forEach</code> method. Lesson 165. I will come back to it. I feel like it has traces of list comprehensions.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to reading Eloquent Javascript, one of the books in my javascript playlist at Safari books online.</li>
            <li>Started learning about Javascript Objects; this is similar to a Dictionary in Python.</li>
            <li>Thinking of creationg a drop-down for the dates at the top that are linking to corresponding daily logs. Save space.</li>
            <li>Looking around the net for JS data science resources. Didn't find anything specific / interesting wrt ds, but found <ul><li><a href="http://javascript.info/" target="_blank">Javascript.info</a> - The Modern Javascript Tutorial. An extensive JS resource.</li>
              <li>JSLint, Javascript - The Good Parts, How Javascript Works - all by <a href="http://crockford.com/javascript/" target="_blank">Douglas Crockford</a>. He has many useful books, videos, tools, and more.</li>
              <li>A cool github respository by Syknapse, where, among other things, <a href="https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker-first-ten-months" target="_blank">he tracks/tracked his programming journey.</a></li></ul></li>
            <li>4:06pm. About to start lesson 190 of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (on Udemy) - Score Keeper Project. Enjoying the Document Object Model lessons. I will revisit them some other time. I think I am taking in too much content, so doing some quizzes as well as implementing ideas on this website will help me retain what I am learning.</a>
            <li>classList.toggle - need to look at again.</>

          <ul>
            <li>I have been doing the Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB) on Udemy. Now on lesson 157 of 400. Javascript arrays.
                 It's pretty similar to Python with a few minor differences so far. indexOf vs. index, " , " vs. " : ", and function vs. def - among other things..</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was listening to "Javascript for Wordpress" podcast, and the guest compared learning a programming language to learning a human language... That you need to learn the fundamentals (important phrases) and keep building until you can write parapgraphs, carry a conversation, write a novel, analyze the ideas, etc. That resonated with me! It also made me not judge javascript by python standards, as I cannot judge one human language against the other. Learn it or ignore it!</li>
            <li>I have been working out in the morning and in the evening. May be workout is a stretch. But I stretch and do few reps of super light dumbbells in the morning, and then walk 1 mile on the treadmill. I like it. Trying to eat healthier at the same time.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the freecodecamp podcast where Quincy interviewed ... the Software Engineering Daily host, <a href="https://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-81-from-poker-to-amazon-engineer-to-host-of-software-engineering-daily-with-jeff-meyerson" target="_blank">Jeff Meyerson</a>! It was 2 hours long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was inspiring on so many levels, to me.</li>
            <li>Time to start getting ready for work. It's 7:46am. Should be out by 8:15am, latest! TGIF!</li>
            <li>Going through Javascript lessons before I sleep. I initially planned to just watch and then "later" do the coding at SoloLearn (the coding App), or when I go to freeCodeCamp later in the year. My reason was that I am just trying to get familiar with Javascript and get a flavor of it - whatever that means. Anyway, I am doing the coding exercises now, like I did for most of HTML and CSS. Here is some basic code.</li>
            <li><p><code><pre>
//Function to find maximum number in an array of numbers
<!--

function printMax(myArray){
    var max = myArray[0];
    for(i=0; i<myArray.length; i++){
        if(myArray[i] > max){
            max = myArray[i];
        }
          }
return max
}


dux = [3, 1, 8, 6, 10, -100, 99, 12, 1]

printMax(dux) -->

            </pre>
            </code></p></li>
            
            
            <li><p><code><pre>
            
//Function to print an array of numbers in reverse
<!--
            
            var max = 0
function printMax(myArray){
    var max = myArray[0];
    for(i=1; i<=myArray.length; i++){
        if(myArray[i] > max){
            max = myArray[i];
        }
          }
return max
}


tux = [3, 1, 8, 6, 10, 100, 99, 12, 1]

            <li>freecodecamp podcast. Deep work, focus, code every day. African / Nigerian dude in Berlin - Ohans Emmanuel. Inspiring!

          <ul>
            <li>For the past couple of weeks/months I have been binge listening to podcasts on particular individuals: Nathan Barry of Convertkit,
              Chris Sacca of Lowercase capital, Josh Pigford of Baremetrics, Quincy Larson of freeCodeCamp, Wes Bos of Javascript30, Evan You of Vue.js, 
              Patrick Collison of Stripe, Shivani Siroya of InVenture, and many others. I realized that listening to several podcasts on the same person 
              provided more depth. Not different from when I was doing research for the "Monetize Like The Best" blog.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks ago, I read "Not Fade Away". It made me rethink how I look at life. Life is short. Treasure each moment.</li>
            <li>The Web Developer Bootcamp continues. Bootstrap 3 completed. I didn't do any exercises. I started Bootstrap 4, but stopped and moved
              forward to Javascript. I have been looking forward to starting Javascript for a while. The first few lessons are a breeze due to my experience with Python.
            I will revist bootstrap via freeCodeCamp. </li>
            <li>Thinking about how I will use this programming knowledge I am "accumulating". Trading algorithms, work dashboards, quiz forums, personal apps, side gigs, ... ... ???</li>

              Mostly last week.</li>
            <li>Thinking about ways to focus / speed up this programming journey, with regard to trading / market analysis.</li>
            <li>Thinking about what language to focus on. Go back to Python? Continue R? Continue HTML / CSS/ JS?</li>
            <li>I have decided to continue with the web dev journey even though I am not planning to be a web developer.</li>

            <li>Bought a couple of domains for the trucking business ideas I had.</li>
            <li>Listened to a couple of coding podcasts. Really liked FreeCodeCamp (FCC)'s ep. 61.</li>
